# Python_100_Days_of_Code
# 100 Days of Code Challenge

To refresh and update my Pythonic abilities, I have started the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 by Dr. Angela Yu.
The key is to complete at least one project a day for the next 100 days while also working on developing my style using Google Python Style Guide and
industry standards for engineering. 

# Kicked off Day 1: [Band Name Generator](Day1_Band_Name_Generator)
This session culminated with a simple program that creates a "Band Name" using inputs from the user for their current city and their pet's name. 
Worked on restricting user inputs to just alphabet letters using **isalpha()**, use the new assignment operator walrus in Python 3.8+ :=, worked on my try/except (I want to call this the try/catch still), and commenting/documenting the functions properly. 

# Day 2 (completed in Day 1): [Tip Generator](Day2_Tip_Generator)
Simple program as well, that generates the tip and allows the user to split the total bill among other diners. Incorporated all the above for coding best practices as I did in Day 1, while working on adding more modularity to my coding.
